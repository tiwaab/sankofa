You are processing a scanned historical book to produce a clean, structured, publishable version suitable for a digital scholarly edition (Quarto book).

CRITICAL: Return response as valid JSON with this exact structure:
```json
{
  "title_page": {"title": "", "author": "", "year": "", "publisher": ""},
  "toc": ["chapter1", "chapter2"],
  "pages": [
    {"page_number": "1", "content": "markdown text here", "chapter": "chapter-06", "filename": "chapter-06-proceedings.qmd", "image_path": ""}
  ],
  "images": [
    {"filename": "map.jpg", "path": "/images/map.jpg", "caption": "Map description"}
  ]
}
```

## CONTENT EXCLUSION RULES (ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL):

### ALWAYS EXCLUDE:
- Printed page numbers at top/bottom of pages (like "12", "13", "MISSION TO ASHANTEE. 13")
- Running headers that repeat across pages (like "MISSION TO ASHANTEE", "APPENDIX")
- Page footers and marginal annotations
- Any text that appears in the same position across multiple pages

### CHAPTER IDENTIFICATION RULES:
- TRUE chapter headings are typically:
  - Centered on page with distinctive formatting
  - Followed by subtitle or chapter description
  - Mark clear narrative breaks
  - Example: "CHAPTER II." followed by "The Route, and Reception of the Mission."
- IGNORE chapter references in running headers (these repeat on every page)
- For pages without clear chapter breaks, assign to previous established chapter

### CONTENT EXTRACTION:
1. **Start Point**: Begin with first actual paragraph of body text, skip all headers/page numbers
2. **Text Processing**: 
   - Preserve original paragraph breaks
   - Maintain sentence structure and punctuation
   - Handle footnotes as: ^[footnote text]
   - Convert structured data to markdown tables
3. **Image Handling**: Insert placeholders where images appear: ![description](filename.jpg)

### EXAMPLE OF WHAT TO EXCLUDE:
```
❌ EXCLUDE: "12    MISSION TO ASHANTEE."
❌ EXCLUDE: "MISSION TO ASHANTEE.    13"
❌ EXCLUDE: Page numbers like "14", "15" at top/bottom
✅ INCLUDE: "The Mission left Cape Coast Castle on the morning of the 22d of April..."
```

### CHAPTER ASSIGNMENT LOGIC:
- If page has a new chapter heading → create new chapter
- If no heading → continue with current chapter
- Use descriptive filenames: "chapter-02-route-reception.qmd"
- Estimate chapter breaks based on narrative flow and content themes

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- One .qmd file per distinct chapter/section
- Maintain chronological reading order
- Clean, publishable markdown content only
- NO page furniture or scanning artifacts
