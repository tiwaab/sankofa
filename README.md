# Historical Book Digitization Pipeline: Scalable OCR for Digital Humanities

## Project Overview

This project transforms photocopied historical texts into accessible, searchable digital formats suitable for scholarly research. Using AWS cloud infrastructure and AI-powered OCR, the system processes scanned PDFs and outputs structured Quarto books ready for web publication.

## Personal Motivation and Research Context

As a person of Ashanti heritage, this project holds deep personal significance. The test corpus—T. Edward Bowdich's 1819 "Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee"—represents the first recorded European contact with the Ashanti Empire. This 556-page document contains the earliest detailed ethnographic observations of my ancestral kingdom, including its political structures, economic systems, cultural practices, and geographical knowledge.

The irony is profound: this foundational text about Ashanti history remains largely inaccessible to Ashanti people and African scholars due to digitization barriers. Physical copies exist primarily in European and American institutions, creating a digital divide that perpetuates colonial-era knowledge inequalities.

## Social Science Research Problem

### Historical Text Accessibility Crisis

Historical documents represent invaluable primary sources for social science research, yet millions remain trapped in inaccessible formats:

**Geographic Barriers**: Original manuscripts exist in single copies at specific institutions, preventing access for researchers from developing countries or limited-resource institutions.

**Inadequate Digital Formats**: Basic PDF scans lack searchable text, proper structure, or metadata. Researchers cannot perform keyword searches, extract data, or integrate materials into digital corpora.

**Economic Constraints**: Traditional digitization costs $2-5 per page. A 500-page text costs $1000-2500 to digitize, making large-scale projects economically impossible.

**Format Fragmentation**: Incompatible formats prevent comparative analysis or computational humanities methods.

### Impact on African Studies

This accessibility gap particularly affects African and postcolonial studies, where primary sources about African societies often exist only in European archives. Scholars from the Global South cannot access materials directly relevant to their communities' histories, perpetuating colonial knowledge structures.

## Justification for Scalable Computing Methods

### Computational Requirements

Historical book digitization requires cloud-scale solutions:

**Volume Processing**: Academic libraries house millions of texts requiring batch processing. Manual transcription of institutional collections would require centuries of human labor.

**OCR Complexity**: Historical texts present unique challenges including variable print quality from aging technologies, diverse font styles across periods, complex layouts with footnotes and marginalia, and mixed text-image content.

**Structured Output Generation**: Converting raw OCR into scholarly formats requires intelligent processing for chapter detection, image handling, metadata extraction, and format conversion for publication platforms.

**Economic Scalability**: Cloud processing reduces per-book costs from thousands to tens of dollars, enabling previously impossible digitization projects.

### Cloud Computing Advantages

**Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous processing of multiple documents or sections dramatically reduces processing time.

**Resource Elasticity**: Automatic scaling based on workload demands without infrastructure investment.

**Global Accessibility**: Cloud-based processing enables worldwide access to digitization services.

**Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use pricing eliminates hardware investments while providing enterprise-grade capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Serverless Infrastructure

The system employs AWS serverless architecture for maximum scalability:

**Event-Driven Processing**: S3 uploads automatically trigger processing workflows without manual intervention.

**ECS Fargate**: Containerized processing for compute-intensive OCR and LLM operations with isolated execution environments.

**Lambda Functions**: Serverless processing that scales automatically based on workload demands.

### Processing Pipeline

1. **PDF Ingestion**: Large texts split into 20-page batches for parallel processing
2. **OCR Processing**: AWS Textract extracts text while preserving layout and structure
3. **Image Extraction**: Mistral OCR identifies and extracts embedded images with metadata
4. **LLM Content Structuring**: Custom prompts guide intelligent parsing, removing artifacts and identifying chapters
5. **Quarto Generation**: Creates publication-ready digital books with integrated text and images

### Scalable Technologies

**Containerization**: Docker ensures consistent execution across environments and enables scaling.

**Managed Services**: Textract and Mistral APIs provide AI capabilities without infrastructure management.

**Distributed Storage**: S3 supports unlimited storage with global accessibility and redundancy.

## Results and Validation

Successfully processed the complete 556-page Bowdich text:
- 28 processing batches with accurate page tracking
- 27 extracted images with descriptive metadata
- Structured chapters with clean content separation
- Publication-ready Quarto book format

**Performance**: 45-minute processing time (99.7% reduction vs. 100+ hours manual transcription)
**Cost**: ~$15 in cloud services (99% reduction vs. $1000-2500 professional transcription)

## Current Limitations

- Optimized for English and Roman alphabets
- Complex layouts may require manual review
- Limited error recovery mechanisms
- Minimal progress tracking visibility

## Future Enhancements

**User Experience**: Progress bars, real-time notifications, comprehensive error logging

**Research Integration**: RAG for text interrogation, full-text search, cross-document reference linking

**Technical Improvements**: Fine-tuned models for historical texts, multi-language support, automated quality assessment

## Impact and Significance

This pipeline democratizes access to historical texts by enabling large-scale digitization at institutional scales while reducing costs by 99%. For African studies specifically, it provides a pathway to make foundational texts about African societies accessible to African scholars and communities.

The system's scalable architecture supports institutional adoption, enabling libraries worldwide to digitize collections efficiently while maintaining scholarly standards. By automating what was previously weeks of manual labor into hours of computational processing, this project enables new scales of digital humanities research while addressing historical inequalities in knowledge access.

The personal significance of digitizing the first European account of the Ashanti Empire exemplifies how technology can help decolonize knowledge by making historically inaccessible materials available to the communities they document.
